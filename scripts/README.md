# Scripts Folder
This folder contains two useful helper scripts to download the list of all available starred characters, and modify/upload to database. This may not be an updated list of files, however effort will be made to keep it updated.

## Files
- [download_waifus_txt.ts](download_waifus_txt.ts): A simple script to retrieve all starred characters from the database, and output into a text file with pretty formatting.
- [upload_waifus_txt.ts](upload_waifus_txt.ts): A simple script to retrieve all starred characters from the text file, and modify any characters that are different from the database, to allow easy and efficient modifying.

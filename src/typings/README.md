# Typings Folder

This folder contains all custom typings that are needed for TypeScript. This folder should only contain declaration
files (`.d.ts` files) and should not contain any implementation files.

## Files

- [client.d.ts](client.d.ts): Custom typings for the discord.js client. This is used to extend the client with custom
  properties and methods.
- [serialize.d.ts](serialize.d.ts): Typings for objects that are serialized by node pg.
